# NgrokWh

The best ngrok for termux, 100% functional and stable. Created by The Famous Sensei

How to install Ngrok for termux without errors:

- INSTALLATION -

`pkg install git`

`pkg update`

`git clone https://github.com/WhBeatZ/NgrokWh.git`

`cd NgrokWh`

`chmod +x ngrokwh.sh`

`bash ngrokwh.sh`

After completing the steps, they go to the browser and create an account on ngrok.io
Once the account is created, it will take you to the home screen called "Setup & Installation" located on the side of the left column.
Then they have to go to the bottom tab, where it says "Your Authoken" click there and it will take you to the page where your authoken is for ngrok to work.
Once there, they have to copy their authoken, even with the words "ngrok authoken" take a good look at the example of what they have to copy.
Example:
 
`ngrok authtoken 21rY4RVawiJksks64mskkdLsbs97PjhBPFQzeE_k4s2N6AjPKSkdidnLSIDNldxusb`

(Each one has its own authoken, don't use the one in the example because it doesn't work.)

That is the authonken they have to copy.
When they have copied it, they return to the terminal, paste it and hit enter.

Now they write:
`ngrok http 8080`

And ngrok would be activated correctly forever :D. I hope it works for you.

WhBeatZ.
